# Anime-Alert
This notification app displays all shows of the current season. The selected show is added to your watchlist and notifications will be sent whenever a new episode is released. As this app is mainly for personal use, the UI wasn't focused so feel free to fork this repo and customize it to your liking.


## Running for local use
The api used for this application is [here](https://github.com/junqili259/Anime-Alert-api)
