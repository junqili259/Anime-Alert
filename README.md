# Anime-Alert
This notification app displays all shows of the current season. The selected show is added to your watchlist and notifications will be sent whenever a new episode is released. As this app is mainly for personal use, the UI wasn't focused so feel free to fork this repo and customize it to your liking.


## Running for local use
The api used for this application is [here](https://github.com/junqili259/Anime-Alert-api) if you wish to use it locally or deploy your own instance(highly recommended). **Note:** The api is deployed through the heroku free tier so the container "falls asleep within 30 mins of inactivity" so you may not see anything on the seasons view controller until the container wakes up to handle your request.
